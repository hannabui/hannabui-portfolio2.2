Here is a project I created. This is a to-do list with some customizable features.
In the right hand corner, you can see a selection of colors to choose from. With a click
of a button, the background will change colors based on what they click. You can also delete
to-do list items if it's not needed anymore as well as marking them as favorites.

In my application I included:

//Changing the colors of the background of the to-do list

//Adding a delete button to delete the to-do list items

//Added a favorite button to the to-do list items to mark as important
